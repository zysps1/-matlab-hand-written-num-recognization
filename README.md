## Digit Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This repository contains my implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for digit recognition. The model is trained to accurately classify handwritten digits using deep learning techniques.

For a detailed tutorial and step-by-step explanation, please refer to my blog post:
